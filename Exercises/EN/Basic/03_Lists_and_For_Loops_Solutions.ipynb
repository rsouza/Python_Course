    "In the previous notebook we understood what variables are and how these can store various values (strings, integers...). \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this notebook, we will expand our toolset with a more complex type of variable - **list**. As you will see, a list can store many elements (not just one like in the variables in previous lecture). \n",
    "- We will learn later on how to manipulate these lists, such as how do we navigate through them and how do we retrieve elements we would like. \n",
    "- In the final part of the notebook we will hop on to a different concept - **loops**. These are closely connected to the topic of lists (and for example retrieval from lists). If the list is *very* long it might become unfeasible to retrieve elements from it manually. We will need loops for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that in this notebook you will already see data being imported. To understand what these imports of libraries are (with all the functions and commands) is not yet a required knowledge. Try to follow only the examples which are shown.\n",
