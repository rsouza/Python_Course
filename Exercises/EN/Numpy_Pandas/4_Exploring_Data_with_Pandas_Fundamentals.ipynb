    "- How to select data from pandas objects using boolean arrays.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction to the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned the basics of the pandas library in the previous chapter and explored some dataframes using the techniques we have learned. Just to refresh your memory:\n",
    "> Axis values in dataframes can have **string labels**, not just numeric ones, which makes selecting data much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Dataframes have the ability to contain columns with **multiple data types**: such as integer, float, and string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll learn some other ways working with data using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, we will continue working with a data set from Fortune magazine's Global 500 list 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a data dictionary for some of the columns in the CSV:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **company**: Name of the company.\n",
    "- **rank**: Global 500 rank for the company.\n",
    "- **revenues**: Company's total revenue for the fiscal year, in millions of dollars (USD).\n",
    "- **revenue_change**: Percentage change in revenue between the current and prior fiscal year.\n",
    "- **profits**: Net income for the fiscal year, in millions of dollars (USD).\n",
    "- **ceo**: Company's Chief Executive Officer.\n",
    "- **industry**: Industry in which the company operates.\n",
    "- **sector**: Sector in which the company operates.\n",
    "- **previous_rank**: Global 500 rank for the company for the prior year.\n",
    "- **country**: Country in which the company is headquartered.\n",
    "- **hq_location**: City and Country, (or City and State for the USA) where the company is headquartered.\n",
    "- **employees**: Total employees (full-time equivalent, if available) at fiscal year-end."
